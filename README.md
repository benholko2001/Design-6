I **hate** Github  
To whom it may concern,  
I had three mental breakdowns while attempting to simply figure out how to change the filetype of this readme to use the Markdown system. All of human intelligence does ot understand how in all the blue hells this damn system works, and I say human intelligence because programmers are not human. This is not slander, it had been conirmed by my programmer friends. These creatures are the only living things that would be so asinie as to make it so that the filetype must be stated in the file name, not set at creation or in a dropdown menu.  
God has forsaken us, and He has done so through this GitHub itself.
